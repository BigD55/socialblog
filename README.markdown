and it is a fork of the sample application for

following the rails tutorial and the forking after the creation of the user model
and instead of creating the micropost model and all that follows, instead create
a blogpost model. 

Should be pretty simple right? 

I don't know. I am at the beginning. I have been quite fascinated by the tutorial
in my first round of following it, but also I have skipped important steps, I didn't do
the excercises, because I was eager to get to the end of it, and didn't have the patience 
to expand my own expertise by doing the "branching" and insecurity of the tasks.

What I want to find out is: Is this really an unmessy way of doing web development?


# this rails dev model seems like development culture, that feels solid. empowering 


A clear goal, and then doing it. Bit by bit. Without wasting time and energy. Doing stuff that is 
reusable, that is what I want. No "hyper" stuff. Simple clear efficient. 
Usable. 

A Blog. Weblog. For different users. Kind of a "platform", but also 

separated blogs. Don't know, how that could play out.
